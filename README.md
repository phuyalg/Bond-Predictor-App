I made a bond predictor as a personal project because I am currently considering pursuing both 
chemistry and computer science at Berea. Also, when learning about intramolecular forces, I found fascinating
that ionic character of two elements can be compared to the Pauling scale to determine the type of bond they will make.
So, I wanted to create a simple tool that would take two elements, calculate their ionic character based on stored electronegativity values, and return what type of bond they would form. 

Through the completion of this project, I developed a proficiency in OOP. My understanding of classes, their uses,
their structure, and their implementation, has all improved tremendously since first learning of OOP. The hardest part of
this program was implementing an interactive graphic for the code that I had written. It was difficult setting up Tkinter 
inside the turtle screen; however, through in person and online resources, I learned the proper syntax to accurately depict 
my code interactively. Knowing what I know now, I will definitely seek help sooner than later on big projects that I am working on.
The help of TAs and Professor Shepherd in resolving minor errors have been invaluable, and I wish I would've received it earlier so 
that a lot more time could be focused on adding new features to the program.
